Game Specifications

This a version of the arcade space game with a space ship and asteroids falling from the top of the screen.
The game starts with the space ship lower level of the screen and the asteroids at the upper level of the screen.
The player has to press on "Left button of the mouse" for the game to start and the asteroids start falling.
The space ship has to dodge the asteroids falling by moving left and right until he can collides with one of them.
The asteroids fall with different velocities and when they reach the end of the screen, some more asteroids start falling from the initial coordinates of the asteroids.

When the space ship collides with one of the asteroids, it triggers the game over function which prints a game over message on the screen as well as instructions to 
restart the game. 
When the game restarts after the space ship collided with one of the asteroids, the asteroids start falling automatically without pressing any mkey.

The game has a functionality to pause and unpause using "space" which means the asteroids will stop falling and not move until "Left button of the mouse" is pressed again.
